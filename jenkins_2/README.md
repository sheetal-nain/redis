#  Jenkins Authentication and Authorization.

Authentication: Verifying the identity of a user (e.g., logging in with a username and password).

Authorization: Granting or restricting access to resources and actions based on the user's identity and assigned permissions.

These two concepts are fundamental to securing any software system, including Jenkins, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive operations and data.
